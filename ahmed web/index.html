       <h2> definition </h2>
        <p1>An Offshore Company refers a corporation, LLC or similar class of entity formed in a foreign country to</br> that of the principals of the organization or one that can only operate outside of its country of formation.</br>This article provides information to help one understand the definition of the term “Offshore Company”</br>and to describe how they differ from domestic companies.

        First of all, we will define the term Offshore</br> Offshore means located or situated beyond one’s national boundaries.</br>The term Offshore Company has two definitions depending on its perspective. From the standpoint of the</br>principals of the company, it is a company that has been filed outside of the country where its principals</br>(officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners) reside. From within its country of formation, it is a company</br>that has been formed for the purpose of operating outside of the jurisdiction where it was originally filed.</p1>
        <h2>Characteristics of offshore companies</h2>
        <p1>Although all offshore companies differ to a degree depending upon the corporate law in the relevant</br> all offshore companies tend to enjoy certain core characteristics:
        <ul>
        <li>They are broadly not subject to taxation in their home jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>The corporate regime will be designed to promote business flexibility.</li>
        <li>Regulation of corporate activities will normally be lighter than in a developed country</li>
        </ul>
        The absence of taxation or regulation in the home jurisdiction does not, of course, exempt the relevant</br>company from taxation or regulation abroad. For example, Michael Kors Holdings Limited is incorporated</br>in the British Virgin Islands, but is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is subject both the</br>U.S. taxation and to financial regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Another</br>common characteristic of offshore companies is the limited amount of information available to</br>the public. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At one end of the scale, in the Cayman Islands</br>and Delaware, there is virtually no publicly available information. But at the other end of the scale,</br>in Hong Kong companies file annual returns with particulars of directors, shareholders and annual accounts.</br>However, even in jurisdictions where there is relatively little information</p1>
